It was long, up to the milestone, and I wasn't always clear on the directions. For the milestone, I would have also preferred a little more time

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

Understanding what was necessary for the constructors, knowing how to link objects. 
BufferPool

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

Right now, Catalog is missing Iterator (although it must be close), and primary key. Additionally, bufferpool concepts.
