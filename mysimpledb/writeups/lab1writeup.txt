Report for Lab 1
----------------

After you complete lab 1, please answer the following questions.  For lab 1, the questions are simple but in future labs you can expect to spend some time answering more detailed questions about the design of your solution.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Michael Dunnegan

2. What did you think of this assignment?

It was long, up to the milestone, and I wasn't always clear on the directions. 
For the milestone, I would have also preferred a little more time. Looking back, time
wasn't necessarily the issue. I'd attribute the difficulty of this lab to my 
lack of recent experience with java. Another thing that I had trouble with was debugging.
I am fairly confident in most of my code, but I could not get all the unit tests
to pass, despite my best efforts. 

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

Understanding what was necessary for the constructors, knowing how to link objects. 
BufferPool

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

All the methods are implemented, however many of them are not passing their unit tests. 
I'm positive that many of them are very close to working. 

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

Around 12-14 hours.
