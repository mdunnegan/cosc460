Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. Operator.java, SeqScan.java, TupleIterator.java
2. Aggregate.java, Delete.java, Filter.java, Insert.java, Join.java, OrderBy.java, Project.java  

3. Project-project, Join-join, Select-filter, Difference-delete, Union-insert, ::: Intersection..., cross product?

4. Filter extends Operator, which means that it inherits .next() and .hasNext() from it's superclass, Operator. It can use these methods. 

5.
	while iterR.has_next
		next = iterR.next
		if next.matches(predicate)
			return next
	return null

6.
	iterR1 = outer relation iterator
	iterR2 = inner relation iterator 
	
	list = []
	while iterR1.has_next
		next1 = next
		iterR2.rewind
		while iterR2.has_next
			next2 = next
			if next1 == next2
				list += next1
	return list	

7.	
	t1 = null
	t2 = null
	
	iterR = R.iterator()
	iterS = S.iterator()
	
	while (iterR.has_next()){
		iterR.rewind();
		t1 = iterR.next();
		while (iterS.has_next()){
			t2 = iterS.next();
			if (t1 == t2){
				return t1;
			}
		}
	}
	return null;
